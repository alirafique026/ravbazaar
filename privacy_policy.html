            To maintain your right to privacy while shopping with us is one of our biggest priorities. 
            We, thus, only ask for the most necessary information that is required for us to complete 
            your order or to contact you regarding its status. The information we collect includes your 
            name, email address, shipping address and billing address. Apart from the <strong>RAV DOWNLOAD</strong> 
            team, this information is only shared with our associated courier partner that will be delivering 
            your ordered items. Please be assured that <strong>ravdownload.com</strong> does not store your credit / debit card 
            or online bank account information. Please note that <strong>ravdownload.com</strong> reserves the right to update 
            this Privacy Policy at any time. We will send you an intimation of the same on the email address

            sensitive data or store it. As you browse <strong>www.ravdownload.com</strong> , advertising cookies will be placed
